1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,240
When the world took shape, four lights of hope fell

2
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:23,110
Lights of hope became crystals with different powers

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,250
One is Rubrum, the Wings of Flame with magic power

4
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:52,290
One is Milites, the Steel Wrist with Magitek Armor

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,210
One is Concordia, the pure eye piercing the sky 

6
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:15,160
One is Lorican, the  mighty shield with a hidden blade

7
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,040
This world is Orience

8
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,240
In a spiral samsara

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,090
the world is waiting for the Agito

10
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,110
The nameless book recorded"9と9が9を迎えし时"
(is the time of [u]world unity[/u])
then   when 9 and 9 usher 9

11
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:40,010
the origin will grants the world "trial"

12
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:46,090
Now   the world comes in another spiral
